        <h2>Dear Agent Glitterbomb,</h2>
        <p>We have an emergency. The secret blueprint for our <span class="blurred">Intergalactic Pizza Engine</span>
            has been intercepted. This device is what allows our pizzas to stay hot and cheesy, even in zero gravity.
        </p>
        <p>We suspect that Commander <span class="blurred">Zog of Planet Cruston </span>is behind this. He has
            transported the blueprint to his <span class="blurred">hidden asteroid base</span>. Your mission is to
            breach the base and secure the blueprint before it is launched into orbit.</p>
        <p>Be sure to keep the baseâ€™s location absolutely confidential. Any leak of this information could spark an
            interstellar food crisis.</p>
