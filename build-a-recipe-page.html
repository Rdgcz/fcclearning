    <li>1 fresh egg</li>

    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Black pepper to taste (optional)</li>

      <li>Crack the egg: Carefully crack the egg into a small plate (to avoid shells falling into the skillet) or directly into the hot skillet.</li>
      <li>Fry the egg: Cook over medium heat until the egg white is set and opaque, but the yolk remains liquid (about 2-3 minutes).</li>
      <li>Season: Remove the egg with a spatula, transfer to a plate, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
