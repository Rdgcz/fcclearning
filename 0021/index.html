        <p class="text">In a stunning political upset, the town of Sleepy Hollow has elected a ginger tabby named
            Whiskers as its new mayor. The feline candidate, running on a powerful platform of mandatory afternoon naps
            and a dramatic increase in tuna distribution, won by a landslide, capturing 98% of the vote from both human
            and local wildlife constituents.</p>
        <p class="text">Campaign manager and owner, Mr. Higgins, stated that Whiskers's straightforward, no-nonsense
            approach to solving complex issues—primarily by sitting on important documents—resonated with a weary
            electorate. His first official act is expected to be the declaration of a national bird-watching holiday.
